<h3>Introduction to Stalin</h3>
<img src="C:\Users\ameno\Music\330px-Stalin_Full_Image.jpg" alt="Joseph Stalin" width="300" height="250">
<p>Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin (born Ioseb Besarionis dzе Jughashvili; 18 December [O.S. 6 December] 1878[1] – 5 March 1953) was a Georgian<br> revolutionary and political leader who governed the Soviet Union from 1924 until his death in 1953. He served as both General Secretary of the<br> Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1922–1952) and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union (1941–1953). Despite initially<br>governing the country as part of a collective leadership, he ultimately consolidated power to become the Soviet Union's dictator by the 1930s. A<br> communist ideologically committed to the Leninist interpretation of Marxism, Stalin formalised these ideas as Marxism–Leninism while his own <br>policies are known as Stalinism.</p>

	Having dropped his editorship of Pravda, Stalin was appointed the People's Commissar for Nationalities. He took Nadezhda Alliluyeva as his<br> secretary and at some point married her, although the wedding date is unknown. In November 1917, he signed the Decree on Nationality, <br>according ethnic and national minorities living in Russia the right of secession and self-determination. The decree's purpose was primarily<br> strategic; the Bolsheviks wanted to gain favour among ethnic minorities but hoped that the latter would not actually desire independence.<br> That month, he travelled to Helsinki to talk with the Finnish Social-Democrats, granting Finland's request for independence in December.<br> His department allocated funds for establishment of presses and schools in the languages of various ethnic minorities. Socialist revolutionaries<br> accused Stalin's talk of federalism and national self-determination as a front for Sovnarkom's centralising and imperialist policies.

	Lenin died in January 1924. Stalin took charge of the funeral and was one of its pallbearers; against the wishes of Lenin's widow, the Politburo<br> embalmed his corpse and placed it within a mausoleum in Moscow's Red Square. It was incorporated into a growing personality cult devoted<br> to Lenin, with Petrograd being renamed "Leningrad" that year. To bolster his image as a devoted Leninist, Stalin gave nine lectures at Sverdlov<br> University on the "Foundations of Leninism", later published in book form. During the 13th Party Congress in May 1924, "Lenin's Testament"<br> was read only to the leaders of the provincial delegations. Embarrassed by its contents, Stalin offered his resignation as General Secretary; this<br> act of humility saved him and he was retained in the position.

	In June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, initiating the war on the Eastern Front. Although intelligence agencies had repeatedly warned<br> him of Germany's intentions, Stalin was taken by surprise. He formed a State Defense Committee, which he headed as Supreme Commander,<br> as well as a military Supreme Command (Stavka), with Georgy Zhukov as its Chief of Staff. The German tactic of blitzkrieg was initially highly<br> effective; the Soviet air force in the western borderlands was destroyed within two days. The German Wehrmacht pushed deep into Soviet territory;<br> soon, Ukraine, Byelorussia, and the Baltic states were under German occupation, and Leningrad was under siege; and Soviet refugees were flooding<br> into Moscow and surrounding cities. By July, Germany's Luftwaffe was bombing Moscow, and by October the Wehrmacht was amassing for a full<br> assault on the capital. Plans were made for the Soviet government to evacuate to Kuibyshev, although Stalin decided to remain in Moscow, believing<br> his flight would damage troop morale. The German advance on Moscow was halted after two months of battle in increasingly harsh weather conditions.
